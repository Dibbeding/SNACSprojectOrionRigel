SNACS - Peer Review:
Introduction:
- supermarket vs super market (?)
- related work in introduction? 
- as you write, a more detailed contribution would be nice to have in the introduction
2.3 Problem statement: 
- example features and why they are used, e.g. just to introduce what a temporal topological feature is?
- (as you write with red:) formulas of logistic regression, clear definitions and notations of features, target, etc.
.(((( by adding these it might not be that short ))))
4. Approach:
- pair ON nodes (pair of nodes) :)
- sampled node pairs: more details about this: why this is necessary, time complexity reasons, how do you sample (why?) 
- introduction of train and test set might better fit to experiments?
- the definition of AUC might be expanded a bit: why 1 is good and 0.5 is worse
- the total number of features used by logistic regr?
- motivation behind using these features? what others could be useD?
5. Datasets:
- what kind of networks are these? from where? is it FB, intsa or what?
- what are the main differences between them?
- are the features have to be calculated by you?


Other
- time complexity might depend on the number of features. How is that influences the training?
- runtime example? or is this not an issue here?
- Do you use an existing API or have to recode the algorithm?
- do you want to compare results with the original paper? are you sure you cant use the same datasets?
- Edge type in table 1 - what is taht?
- maybe some more figures? it feels hard to add any but maybe some explanatory at the begining

- very precise referencing
- neat format (maybe table positioning could be improved, but it is hard before the end of the project (imo))
- detailed related work discovery
- clear introduction and statement of the topic, with some examples
- in total a very intresting topic with good ideas added
