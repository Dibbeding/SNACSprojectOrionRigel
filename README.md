The repository is struxtured in a way that 'embed' folder contains all necessary code to run Rigel API and evaluate results.
Input and output files are saved to separate folders.
Results are collected in separate notebooks:
	- Evaluations per dataset: result_report_[DATASET NAME].ipynb
	- Comparisons accross datasets: plot_results.ipynb
	- Input preparation and metrics: Paper_project_real_data.ipynb
Pickle files are included for recontructory reasons.
